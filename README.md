These are all the codes i did to my Computer Networks class (also may contain some other codes i did ff).

To run you usually have to open 2 terminals, run first the Server file on the first one and then the Client file on the second one.


The first folder is an Client-Server program using TCP. The Server waits for a message from the Client, and after the first one on the next 10s the Server mirrors all the messages back to the Client

Second folder is like the first one, but the time limit is removed and the Client now has to wait the answer from the Server to send the next one.

The third one uses UDP, and the Server mirrors the clients messages untill it says "Tchau" (Goodbye).
